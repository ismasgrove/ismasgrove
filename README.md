### i was told profile README's were cool

Greetings! `ismasgrove` is a Hollow Knight reference, but `isma` is close enough to my real name so feel free to call me by it. I have a nice relationship with coding, and I'm mostly drawn to things adjacent to graphics and PL. I'm also _really_ into shader development. My other hobbies include reading, anime and posing as a green tea connoisseur.

I also have an ever-growing site for small self-contained `@react-three` demos which you can find [here](https://ismasgrove.me)!
